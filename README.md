# PYBD_SF6-wavetable_synth

Currently, a collection of functions that would be pretty inefficient if they were done, files lifted off of other people's repositories (thanks all!) and just generally a public embarassment.
Eventually intended to be a wavetable synthesizer capable of producing 12 simultaneous independent signals which will/should be sent to an offboard 12-channel DAC.
We'll see!
